Like all AI, generative AI is powered by ML modelsâ€”very large models that are pretrained on vast corpuses of data and commonly referred to as Foundation Models (FMs). Transition. Recent advancements in ML (specifically the invention of transformer-based neural network architecture) have led to the rise of  models that contain billions of parameters or variables")

With foundation models, instead of gathering labeled data for each model and training multiple models, customers can use the same pretrained FM to adapt various tasks. FMs can also be customized to perform domain-specific functions that are differentiating to their businesses, using only a small fraction of the data and compute required to train a model from scratch.")
